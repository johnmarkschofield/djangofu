============
django-fu
============

by John Mark Schofield (jms@schof.org)

Provides common utility functions for Django projects.

(It's django-fu as in Kung Fu, not as in F-U.)



Currently provides django-fu.djangoenvironment.get_env_variable().

Loads an environment variable into the current context, or raises an exception.


Thanks

get_env_variable was taken from the book "Two Scoops of Django," by Daniel Greenfield and Audrey Roy. [https://django.2scoops.org/]
